# Mapping Extensions

This module is a fork of the official [Mapping](https://omeka.org/s/modules/Mapping/) module (v2.2.0), retaining all its core features and serving as a full replacement. In addition, it introduces enhanced capabilities including linked item mapping, group-based visualizations, and support for journey maps.
